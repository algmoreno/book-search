# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description

This is a book search engine that allows users to search, add and manage their saved books. The app uses the full MERN stack and originally used Restful API but was refactored with graphql. Using graphql as the single endpoint it was necessary to add typeDefs, resolver, queries and mutations. Additionally, we had to create the Apollo Provider so that every request would work with Apollo
